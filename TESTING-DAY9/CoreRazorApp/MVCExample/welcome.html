        <pre>Nature is everything around us that makes life possible and beautiful. 
It includes the air we breathe, the weather we feel, the plants, animals, and everything we see outside. 
We call it "Mother Nature" because, like a mother, it provides us with everything we need, such as food, clothes, and shelter. 
When we step outside, the sunlight, trees, flowers, and cool breeze remind us of how amazing nature is.
Nature has been here long before humans and continues to support life. 
Whether it’s the calm of the morning or the sounds of birds, nature makes our lives better every day.
When writing an essay on nature, it’s important to show how closely it is connected to our lives and why we need to protect it. 
By taking care of nature, we can make sure that future generations get to enjoy its beauty and benefits too.
